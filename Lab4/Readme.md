Activity2 => The BookTown Service can be run as a gradle project with `./gradlew bootRun` . I have added an embedded derby database with the project and it has a bootstrap script that also adds author data during the server startup. Additionally i have used Spring JPA
Activity3 => I have bootstrapped the PhoneBook to preload with a set of areaCodes as a List Collection. The service again can be started with just a `./gradlew bootRun`
